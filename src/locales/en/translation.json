In the Middle Ages, the street was home to these artisans, who played a crucial role in Bremen’s maritime trade. The cooper's craft was essential for the storage and transportation of goods, particularly in a city so closely tied to its port. As such, Böttcherstraße was originally a place of industry and commerce, deeply connected to Bremen's economic lifeblood.",
