# QR Code Menu for Pizzeria

## Description
This project is designed to create a digital menu for pizzerias using QR codes. Customers can scan the QR code with their smartphones and easily view the menu, place orders, and access special offers without interacting with a physical menu.
QR Code Menu allows pizzerias to create a dynamic, easily updatable menu accessible via a QR code. This solution enhances customer convenience, reduces the use of paper materials, and speeds up the ordering process.


### How It Works

- Create the Menu: The pizzeria's menu can be created in HTML format, displaying information about pizzas, drinks, sauces, and other products.
- Generate the QR Code: A QR code is generated that links to the URL of the menu page. Customers scan the QR code on their phones and open the menu.
- Instant Updates: The menu can be updated in real time. Any changes will be reflected immediately for all customers scanning the QR code.

### Features

- Responsive Design: The menu automatically adjusts to the screen size of the device (smartphone or tablet).
- Ease of Use: Users only need to scan the QR code to access the menu.
- Updatable: The menu can be updated without changing physical materials.
- Multi-language Support: The ability to integrate the menu in different languages for international customers.
- Staff Convenience: The ordering system can be integrated with the pizzeria's POS system for easier order processing.
